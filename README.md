## Welcome to my Profile!

#### I like to explore the whole realm of coding and software engineering. Started off with C in 2021, got into some low level stuff, later on built some group projects in Java and machine learning in Python.

#### Currently evolving into a fullstack dev with the addition of TS and Vue
